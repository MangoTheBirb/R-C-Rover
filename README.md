# RC-Rover
This project's goal is to control an R/C car through a cellular signal using a raspberry pi and a 3g/4g HAT from sixfabs. From there, there are tons of possibilities for awesome upgrades and features to add, like: use solar panels to make it a true rover with infinite range, use larger batteries to go further on one charge, add a speaker and mic to talk to people through the rover, use a gimbal to look around with the camera and have a more stable view, and plenty of others.

I will start by making the car work through Wi-Fi, once I've done that I will get it working cellularly.
